# number-guessing-game
This was a practice excercise I completed through codeacademy HTML/CSS/ Javascript introcutory courses. 
It is a game with set parameters.
The goal of the game is to guess a random chosen number 1-100.
The player has a maximum of 10 guesses to guess the number. After each guess the player will recieve a "WRONG" or "RIGHT" as the result as well as a clue whether the number they guessed is higher or lower than the correct number.
When the correct number is guessed "RIGHT" will appear in green.
If the player can not guess the number after 10 attempts "GAME OVER" will appear in red as the result.
